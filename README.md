  ## Description
  The text editor is the perfect example of a progressive web application running in a user's browser! The app serves as a great place for users to write notes or snippets of code with or without internet connection. All notes will be saved to the database, and can be retrieved after refreshes or exitting and re-entering the app. Data is stored using an indexDB database, and utilizes many packages. Of which include:- but not limited to- several extentions of webpack plugins, babel and CSS loaders, idb -a wrapper for the API-, and concurrently to run client and server together!
